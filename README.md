### [Create a Method on an Object](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/create-a-method-on-an-object)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
An objects function must be initialized within the object itself.  This is demonstrated in the following code.
```js
let obj = {
  property1 = 1,
  
  function1: function() {
    // Code to be executed
  }
};
```
